# uBlock Origin – Personal Filter List

This repository contains my **personal uBlock Origin filter list**.

The rules are primarily based on and inspired by the solutions documented in the
official r/uBlockOrigin wiki, specifically the YouTube-related filtering guidelines:

https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/wiki/solutions/youtube/

I do **not** aim to replicate the entire wiki.  
Instead, this list represents **what I personally consider important and useful** for my own browsing experience.

## Purpose

- Personal, opinionated filter selection  
- Focus on practical and stable rules  
- No aggressive or experimental filtering  
- Maintained primarily for my own use, but publicly shared  

## Usage

1. Open uBlock Origin
2. Go to **Dashboard → Filter lists**
3. Add this custom filter list:
4. Apply changes

## Notes

- This is **not an official filter list**
- Rules may change at any time without notice
- Updates reflect changes to my personal setup
- Use at your own discretion
