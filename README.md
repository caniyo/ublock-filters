# uBlock Filters

Personal uBlock Origin filter lists.

This repository contains **small, personal and opinionated filters**
that I use to remove annoyances, broken UX and visual clutter on the web.

The filters here are primarily maintained for **my own use**.
They may be site-specific, experimental, or change without notice.

## Usage

You can subscribe to any filter list directly in uBlock Origin
using the raw GitHub URL of the file.

Example:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caniyo/ublock-filters/main/annoyances.txt

## Notes

- No guarantees of long-term stability
- Filters are added when something becomes annoying enough
- Not intended to be a general-purpose filter collection
- Feel free to fork or copy anything useful
