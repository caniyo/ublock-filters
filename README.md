# 🧹 BroomTube / uBlock Filters

This repository contains a personal **uBlock Origin filter list** used to clean up YouTube.

The filters remove or reduce:
- YouTube Shorts
- Live streams and streamed videos
- Endscreen and pause recommendations
- Paid promotion overlays
- Various UI clutter elements

The list is intended for **personal use** and is published mainly so it can be easily subscribed to via GitHub.

## Usage

You can subscribe to this filter list directly in uBlock Origin:

1. Open **uBlock Origin Dashboard**
2. Go to **Filter lists**
3. Scroll down to **Custom**
4. Add the raw URL of `filters.txt`, for example:
5. Click **Apply changes**

## Important Notes

- All cosmetic filters are intentionally kept **single-line**  
  (formatting cosmetic filters across multiple lines can break functionality in uBlock Origin).
- The list is maintained conservatively:
  - no experimental layout hacks
  - no aggressive rendering changes
- Filters are only added if they have been tested to work reliably.
